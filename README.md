# E-commerce Website Mockup Project

This project was undertaken as part of my training program. The primary objective was to design a mockup of an e-commerce website using the Figma tool and then implement this mockup using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional website. The project includes personas and a context to guide the design.

<div style="text-align: center;">
